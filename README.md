# ðŸ§  KlinDart

KlinDart is a collection of opinionated custom lint rules for Dart and Flutter projects. It focuses on improving code **readability**, **maintainability**, and **scalability** by enforcing architectural and stylistic best practices.

## âœ¨ Features

| Rule Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `avoid_hardcoded_strings_in_ui` | Discourages hardcoded string literals directly inside widgets to improve localization readiness. |
| `avoid_string_literals_in_logic` | Flags string literals used in conditions, comparisons, or logicâ€”suggests constants or enums instead. |
| `cognitive_complexity`           | Warns about methods/functions that are too complex to easily understand or maintain. |
| `function_length`                | Enforces a maximum function/method size to encourage smaller, testable units. |
| `class_length`                   | Prevents overly long classes that may violate single-responsibility principle. |
| `file_length`                    | Warns about files that exceed a configurable number of lines. Useful for splitting concerns. |
